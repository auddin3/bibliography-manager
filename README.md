# Command-Line Bibliography Manager

The Command-Line Bibliography Manager is a simple Python script that allows you to manage bibliographic entries through a command-line interface. You can add, view, delete, and list bibliography entries. The data is stored in a JSON file for easy persistence.

## Features

- Add new bibliography entries with citation keys, titles, authors, and publication years.
- View details of a specific bibliography entry using its citation key.
- List all available bibliography entries.
- Delete a specific bibliography entry using its citation key or clear the whole thing. 
- Save and load the bibliography data to/from a JSON file.
